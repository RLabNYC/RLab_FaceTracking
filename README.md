## Description
Now with ARKit and an iPhone with a front-facing True Depth camera you can track your facial features allowing you animate digital avatars. The avatars first have to be prepared with point-level animation called blendshapes.  ARKit uses 52 of these to animate the avatar faces.  3D modelling is a craft that takes a long time to master and setting up all of these blendshapes can be daunting, so we’ve developed a workflow to ease the barrier to get your character up and running in a matter of minutes by leveraging three free avatar creation tools: Reallusion, Adobe Fuse and MakeHuman. All three programs have more than enough blendshapes to animate a face, they just need to be renamed to the ARKit conventions. We’ve developed a simple script to automate of lot of this process.
